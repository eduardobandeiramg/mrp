# The Project
This project was developed as part of a graduation subject assignment, along with other colleagues. 

I was the responsible for the mobile front-end development, and the others took care of the back-end and the web front-end.

The system is a simple version of an hypothetical MRP (Manufacturing Resources Planning) system. It's goal is to optimise and automate the resources management in an production line. The system has 3 different role-based users: i) manufacturing manager; ii) manufacturing supervisor and factory worker.

This system integrates functionalities for inventory control, production order management, material requisitions and demand forecasting, providing a clear and centralized view of all manufacturing operations. The goal is to improve operational efficiency, reduce costs, and ensure material availability, thereby supporting strategic decision-making within the company.
